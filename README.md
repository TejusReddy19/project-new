Spotify API is used 
To create an app on the Spotify Developer Dashboard, follow these steps:

Visit the Spotify Developer Dashboard and log in to your Spotify account. If you don't have an account, you can create one for free.

Once logged in, click on the "Create an App" button or navigate to the "Dashboard" section and click on "Create an App."

Fill in the necessary details for your application, including the name, description, and any other required information.

After completing the form, click on the "Create" button to create your Spotify application.

Once your application is created, you'll be redirected to the application's dashboard. Here, you can find your Client ID and Client Secret. Make sure to keep your Client Secret confidential and secure.

You can now use the Client ID and Client Secret in your application to authenticate and interact with the Spotify API.
